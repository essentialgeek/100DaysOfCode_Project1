# 100DaysOfCode_Project1

This project is from the Udemy course "50 Projects in 50 Days" by Brad Traversy and Florin Pop. This was the first project, aka "Day 1: Expanding Cards." 

Since this is part of my first "100 Days" journey, I wanted to make some notes to myself about what I would like to learn more about, based on this lesson:

Things I want to learn more about:
<ul>
  <li>Javascript arrow functions</li>
  <li>Javascript forEach method</li>
  <li>querySelectorAll method (can always learn more about the DOM methods)</li>
  <li>VS Code extenion settings (I use Dreamweaver but this course uses VD Code, so it's a little different for me)</li>
  <li>-CSS everything, as usual</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Lesson notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>When grabbing images from Unsplash, I needed to use horizontally-oriented photos, otherwise the rounded corners and text disappeared.</li>
  <li>I had to change the background-size for the photos (in the panel div) to "auto"; when using "auto 100%" the photos weren't wide enough when displayed on a desktop browser.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions for me to explore:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How might I work this into a page with other content above and/or below the expanding card?</li>
</ul>
